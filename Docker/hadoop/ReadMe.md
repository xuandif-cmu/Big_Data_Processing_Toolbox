# Toolbox-hadoop

The multinode-hadoop is built upon this application(https://github.com/lvntyldz/docker-multinode-hadoop), which will allow us to create one master container and multiple slave containers through simply running,
  ```
  ./run.sh [slave_num]
  ```
  There is some problem with run.sh in the original package, it is now fixed to follow bash syntax.
